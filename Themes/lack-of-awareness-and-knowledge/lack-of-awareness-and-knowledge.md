# Lack of Awareness and Knowledge

## Key Challenges
* Does management tell them to support accessibility?
    * "Management" could mean senior leadership, a manager, or set of contributing guidelines for an open source project
* Is accessibility part of the requirements?
* The breadth and depth of accessibility is too hard for a person new to accessibility - it needs to get easier
* Need to get people to understand the “why”
* So many standards and regulations - where to start?
* Needing people to understand that automated tests are only part of the process - more is needed.
* Accessibility testing tools are not in the places they need to be. (i.e. when writing emails, when uploading docs to a CMS)

## Solution Approaches 
* Telling stories - telling stories of people with disabilities and how they use technology is powerful.
* GitHub has an option for a project to require accessibility with code commits (it’s an opt-out system)
* Creating dashboards for accessibility support in projects

The rest of this discussion was about one solution - a dashboard for accessibility metrics of open source projects, but the dashboard is designed to be supportive and encouraging, not shaming.

## Success Metrics
This is focused on a dashboard of accessibility support in open source projects.

* Do they have accessibility tests as part of their project?
* How many accessibility bugs does a project have?
* Show changes over time

## Action Plan
This is focused on a dashboard of accessibility support in open source projects.

* Open issues against the project in GitHub based on the data from the dashboard
* Co-pilot to create a solution and give guidance for logged problems
* If a project wants to participate and improve their accessibility
    * Access to Accessibility Slack channel
    * Free access to paid training resources (from vendors)
    * Hackathon options to tackle accessibility issues for a project
        * Accessibility Awareness Lab
    * Invited accessibility mentors
        * Could be a passion project for someone who really wants to improve the accessibility of a project.
        * Could be set up through established accessibility mentoring programs


## Community Support Needs
This is focused on a dashboard of accessibility support in open source projects.


* Dashboard ownership
* Governance body to handle processes around the dashboard
* Access to locked-down resources
    * Accessibility Slack channel
    * Paid training resources
* Hackathon resources - bringing in accessibility experts to help run it and consult on issues
* Managing mentor process (for longer term support)
* Build the co-pilot to create comments on bugs filed against the project (give guidance and suggestions for fixes)

# Information and Documentation Gaps

## Key Challenges
* Keeping docs up to date:
    * How do you require it before launch?
    * How often do you update it?
    * How do you enforce this?
* How complex should the support docs be?
    * Finding the balance between depth and breadth
    * Plain language laws
    * How to support people with different user needs without a lot of hoops to jump through
* How to be a facilitator in agile development?
* Mythical phase two of docs - how to get leadership buy-in?
* Versioning of docs - how many to keep?

## Solution Approaches 
* Pro-active documentation
* Making sure the way docs are captured and shared are accessible
* CI/CD for docs
    * Looks for keywords - create a flag
    * Test-driven docs
    * Alignment with partner documentation counterparts
* Don't send anything that isn't important
* Make reading required :sweat_smile:
* Create spaces to ask questions - make it as inclusive as possible

## Success Metrics
* KPI for support calls
* Doc feedback - thumbs up or thumbs down
* A user performs an action
* Read receipt
* User testing for docs
* Editorial workflow
* 404 problem with knowledge
    * Create a signpost for users
    * Summary of what you need to know and why
    * Supporting readers with the context needed without going to a new location
    * Who are the knowledge gatekeepers - break down the gates and share with others esp newbies

## Action Plan
* Win the lottery
* Kick, scream, and threaten
* Be proactive, not reactive - businesses are more receptive when their house is not on fire
* Create buy-in for leaders by arguing the business case
* Bleeding edge - being the market leader
* Encourage larger companies to model best practices
    * Influences smaller teams to do this too
    * Get Apache and Linux on board
* Credit system to encourage individuals and companies to contribute (Drupal CMS does this now)
* Accessibility knowledge required for certain certifications
* Awareness and education
    * What skills do companies need?
    * Build opportunities to mentor new people interested in the space
    * Go into the classrooms and speak on accessibility
    * Teach Access and Jobs for the Future - example orgs to partner with
    * Don't limit to just college CS majors - could even be K-12 or up-skilling programs

## Community Support Needs
* Accessibility SMEs
* People in the disability community
* Open-source maintainers
* Other people in the open-source community
* Anyone who cares about users and inclusion
* Leaders in organizations and companies that support open source
* Dependent organizations and companies
* Individuals who sponsor, collaborate on, or use the documentation

# Community Communication and Collaboration

## Key Challenges
* Target audience
* Gatekeeping, barriers, closed forums
* Ableism. And the assumption that people with disabilities are not (already) in the community.
* Lack of representation for PWDs in accessible tools and collaboration.
* Lack of exchanges between disabled and non-disabled individuals.
* Tools, platforms
* Inclusion of awareness
* Finite resources: money, time, education, accommodation, human effort

## Solution Approaches 
* Repo owners must provide ability for public to open accessibility PRs
* Work on a11y bugs if open source
* Report a11y bugs (particularly in open source products)
* Publicly list accessible open-source tools
* Create OS license that includes accessibility
* Create/attend meetups
* Leadership buy-in and prioritization
* Include open source a11y in mainstream tech events
* Simplify open-source tools, especially for users who are disabled, young, new

## Success Metrics
* Number of accessibility requests made
* Accessibility PRs open/closed
* Number of discussions on accessibility issues
* Accessibility scores increase / number of scanned issues decrease
* Accessibility “Yelp” rating improves
* Number of school talks per year
* Number of implementations, forks, comments of the OS license that includes accessibility
* How many organizations hire PWDs

## Action Plan
* Engage CAOS (reference the lightning talk) that includes accessibility; there’s much alignment
* Write/publish OS license that includes accessibility – may require lawyer
* Engage Teach Access to find speakers/ambassadors for speaking at schools
* Engage a11yHead (reference the lightning talk) for list of accessible open-source tools
* Engage GAAD for pledge for orgs to use the open-source license that includes accessibility

## Community Support Needs
* Write blog posts / articles / LinkedIn
* Attend/speak at meetups
* Email list
* Do items in Action Plan above
* “You're not alone!”

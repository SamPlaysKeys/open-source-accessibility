# Testing and Tooling Difficulties

## Key Challenges
Testing tools don’t accurately reflect or address the needs of all:
* Staffing
* Leading testing by someone lacking experience (e.g., in usability and accessibility)
* Ambiguity in standards or how to make something accessible
* Specific App challenges, i.e. “Screen reader in a terminal”
* Multiple accessibility standards and required skillsets (e.g., in a team)
* Scope of testing
* Manual testing / Resources / Availability of tools
* Universal Availability vs. Accessibility

## Solution Approaches 
* More accessibility training (e.g., test your websites, monitor)
* Improve accessibility (e.g., close gap between designer/developer/tester)
* Change global culture
* AI-based testing
* Target accessibility efforts on areas that need them
* Evaluate universal accessibility vs. accessibility-specific implementation

## Success Metrics
Hard to prove success - the more specific the disability, the less % of the user-base:
* Increase in accessibility users through web traffic
* Accessibility friendly bridges
* Decrease in lawsuits
* Time-to-success, time-to-degree, time-to-certification, etc

## Action Plan
* Sell financial and moral value of accessibility to leadership
* Design a unified design system
* Automate accessibility tests covered by design system
* Introduce an accessibility training program (e.g., gamification)
* Employment contract commitment for developers, project managers, special heads (e.g., accessibility leads)
* Self-training of at least one accessibility skill per month
* Centralized reporting (e.g., for project managers, product managers, designers)
* Design a mix of dev/tester teams (maybe with accessibility resources)
* Add different testing arrays (e.g., devices, operating systems, tools)

Many steps are available for internal- or project-based testing, but don’t influence the community as a whole.

## Community Support Needs
* Success happens when people of all experience levels are engaged with the effort – Incentivize the community to build adoption.
* Create a “Step 0” to lower the floor for getting engaged with Accessibility development.
* Drive interest in accessibility through community challenges
* Raise awareness of tools (e.g., Lighthouse, axe, Wave)
* Promote a culture of visibility / reporting

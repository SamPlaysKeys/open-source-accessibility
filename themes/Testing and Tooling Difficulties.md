# Theme Overview
Accessibility testing remains challenging due to **labor-intensive** processes, **expensive** tooling, and the difficulty of testing without personal experience using assistive technologies. There's also **over-reliance on automated tools** that cannot solve all accessibility problems.


# Recommended Next Steps
While we did identify many items within each of the following categories, this was not an exhaustive discussion, and our strongest focus for change was on the community support needs.
If we were to continue the discussion with a fresh take on the categories, knowing what we now know, the conversation would be focused primarily on **engaging the open-source community to create concerted efforts to test for accessibility.**
In practice, we referred often to the current state of cybersecurity as a great example on crowdsourcing testing. Through CTFs, bug bounties, and many other incentives, a culture has been created focused on responsibly testing the cybersecurity posture of open-source and public projects.
We see this as the goal for accessibility: **Incentivizing the open-source community to crowd-test the accessibility of public projects, software, websites, and anything else they can.**


# Categories, summaries, and sticky notes
During the small group, we used sticky notes to identify elements of five categories of the challenege of testing and tooling: Key Challenges, Solution Approaches, Success Metrics, Action Plan, and Community Support Needs.

| Key Challenges | Solution Approaches | Success Metrics | Action Plan | Community Support Needs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Overview:** Testing tools don't accurately reflect or address the needs of all. | **Options:** <br>‚Ä¢ Training <br>‚Ä¢ Culture <br>‚Ä¢ AI-based testing <br>‚Ä¢ User-based testing | **Overview:** Hard to prove success - the more specific the disability, the less % of the user-base. | **Overview:** Many steps are available for internal- or project-based testing, but don't influence the community as a whole. | **Overview:** Success happens when the lowest common denominator is engaged with the effort. Incentivize the community to build adoption. |
| **Staffing** | More accessibility training (e.g., test your websites, monitor) | Increase in accessibility users through web traffic | Sell financial & moral value of accessibility to leadership | Create a "Step 0" to lower the floor for getting engaged with Accessibility development. |
| **Leading testing by someone lacking experience** (e.g., in usability and accessibility) | Improve accessibility (e.g., close gap between designer/developer/tester) | Accessibility friendly bridges | Design a unified design system | Drive interest in accessibility through community challenges |
| **Ambiguity in standards** or how to make something accessible | Change global culture | Decrease in lawsuits | Automate accessibility tests covered by design system | Raise awareness of tools (e.g., Lighthouse, axe, Wave) |
| **Specific App challenges**, i.e. "Screen reader in a terminal" | AI-based testing | **Time-to-success** <br>‚Ä¢ Time-to-degree <br>‚Ä¢ Time-to-certification, etc | Introduce an accessibility training program (e.g., gamification) | Promote a culture of visibility / reporting |
| **Multiple accessibility standards** and required skillsets (e.g., in a team) | Target accessibility efforts on areas that need them | | Employment contract commitment for developers, project managers, special heads (e.g., accessibility leads) | |
| **Scope of testing** | Evaluate universal accessibility vs. accessibility-specific implementation | | Self-training of at least one accessibility skill per month | |
| **Manual testing / Resources / Availability of tools** | | | Centralized reporting (e.g., for project managers, product managers, designers) | |
| **Universal Availability vs. Accessibility** | | | Design a mix of dev/tester teams (maybe with accessibility resources) | |
| | | | Add different testing arrays (e.g., devices, operating systems, tools) | |

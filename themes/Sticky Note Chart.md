# Testing and Tooling Difficulties - Sticky Note Chart

| Key Challenges | Solution Approaches | Success Metrics | Action Plan | Community Support Needs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Overview:** Testing tools don't accurately reflect or address the needs of all. | **Options:** <br>• Training <br>• Culture <br>• AI-based testing <br>• User-based testing | **Overview:** Hard to prove success - the more specific the disability, the less % of the user-base. | **Overview:** Many steps are available for internal- or project-based testing, but don't influence the community as a whole. | **Overview:** Success happens when the lowest common denominator is engaged with the effort. Incentivize the community to build adoption. |
| **Staffing** | More accessibility training (e.g., test your websites, monitor) | Increase in accessibility users through web traffic | Sell financial & moral value of accessibility to leadership | Create a "Step 0" to lower the floor for getting engaged with Accessibility development. |
| **Leading testing by someone lacking experience** (e.g., in usability and accessibility) | Improve accessibility (e.g., close gap between designer/developer/tester) | Accessibility friendly bridges | Design a unified design system | Drive interest in accessibility through community challenges |
| **Ambiguity in standards** or how to make something accessible | Change global culture | Decrease in lawsuits | Automate accessibility tests covered by design system | Raise awareness of tools (e.g., Lighthouse, axe, Wave) |
| **Specific App challenges**, i.e. "Screen reader in a terminal" | AI-based testing | **Time-to-success** <br>• Time-to-degree <br>• Time-to-certification, etc | Introduce an accessibility training program (e.g., gamification) | Promote a culture of visibility / reporting |
| **Multiple accessibility standards** and required skillsets (e.g., in a team) | Target accessibility efforts on areas that need them | | Employment contract commitment for developers, project managers, special heads (e.g., accessibility leads) | |
| **Scope of testing** | Evaluate universal accessibility vs. accessibility-specific implementation | | Self-training of at least one accessibility skill per month | |
| **Manual testing / Resources / Availability of tools** | | | Centralized reporting (e.g., for project managers, product managers, designers) | |
| **Universal Availability vs. Accessibility** | | | Design a mix of dev/tester teams (maybe with accessibility resources) | |
| | | | Add different testing arrays (e.g., devices, operating systems, tools) | |
